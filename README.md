# lhc_gcm_extension
An extension to enable FCM push notifications for livehelperchat android app.

**For UPDATE**
If you already have the extension installed,
1. Just replace the content of <LHC_install_dir>/extension/gcm with the content from 'gcm' directory.
2. Clear LHC cache from LHC settings page for update to reflect.

**Installation**
To Install Extension 
1. Download the extension and copy the 'gcm' directory to <LHC_install_dir>/extension
2. Activate the extension by adding 'gcm' to the 'extension' array in <LHC_install_dir>/settings/settings.ini.php 
[e.g look for  'settings' => array ('site' =>array ( 'extensions' =>array ( 0 =>'gcm'),]

Refer to this for example: https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/0f5127f58d0238888d6dc368662cfcd6fcc62c7e/lhc_web/settings/settings.ini.default.php#L25

Note: Path to extension directory should be '<LHC_install_dir>/extension/gcm' else it won't work.
